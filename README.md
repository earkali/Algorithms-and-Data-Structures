# 📚 C Programming Examples - Algorithms and Data Structures

A collection of C programming examples demonstrating fundamental concepts in algorithms and data structures. These examples were created during programming courses and serve as educational resources.

## 📁 Project Contents

This repository contains practical C programming examples covering:

### 🔧 File Handling Example (`fileHandling.c`)
A complete file management system demonstrating:
- **Product Management**: Add, update, display, and delete products
- **File Operations**: Binary file reading/writing with structs
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Interactive console-based user interface

**Features:**
- Product structure with ID, name, price, and stock
- Binary file operations using `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`
- Dynamic file management with temporary files
- Error handling for file operations

### 🔗 Linked List Implementation (`nodeProject.c`)
A comprehensive linked list implementation featuring:
- **Node Structure**: Dynamic memory allocation for nodes
- **List Operations**: Insert at beginning, middle, and end
- **Deletion**: Remove nodes by position
- **Traversal**: Display entire linked list

**Features:**
- Singly linked list with integer data
- Position-based insertion and deletion
- Memory management with `malloc` and `free`
- Interactive menu system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C compiler (GCC, Clang, or any C99 compatible compiler)
- Basic understanding of C programming concepts

### Compilation Instructions

**For File Handling Example:**
```bash
gcc fileHandling.c -o fileHandling
./fileHandling
```

**For Linked List Example:**
```bash
gcc nodeProject.c -o nodeProject
./nodeProject
```

- **User Interface**: Menu-driven console applications
- **Error Handling**: File operation error checking

## 🔧 Key Concepts Covered

### Data Structures
- **Structs**: Product management with multiple data types
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data structure implementation
- **Pointers**: Memory addressing and manipulation

### File Operations
- **Binary Files**: Efficient data storage and retrieval
- **File Pointers**: Sequential and random access
- **Temporary Files**: Safe file modification techniques

### Programming Techniques
- **Modular Design**: Function-based program structure
- **Input Validation**: User input error checking
- **Memory Safety**: Proper allocation and deallocation

## 📚 Educational Value

These examples are perfect for:
- **C Programming Students**: Learning fundamental concepts
- **Data Structure Learners**: Understanding linked lists and file operations
- **Algorithm Practice**: Implementing basic CRUD operations
- **Memory Management**: Learning dynamic memory allocation

## 🛠️ Development Environment

- **Language**: C (C99 standard)
- **Compiler**: GCC recommended
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **IDE**: Any C-compatible editor (VS Code, Dev-C++, CodeBlocks)

## 📝 Code Structure

Both programs follow similar patterns:
1. **Header Includes**: Standard C libraries
2. **Structure Definitions**: Data organization
3. **Function Declarations**: Prototype definitions
4. **Main Function**: Program entry point and menu loop
5. **Implementation Functions**: Core functionality

## 🔍 Code Analysis

### File Handling Program
